# I'm getting errors in the console!

If you're seeing errors in the server console, here's how to address them:

1. **Read the error message carefully**: The error message often contains clues about what went wrong. For example, a "YAML syntax error" points to a problem in your `.yml` file, while a "type mismatch error" suggests that a value in your configuration has the wrong data type.
2. **Use the `ucilogs` command**: This command will generate a log code that you can share with the developers in the UncomplicatedCustomServer Collective Discord server. This will help them diagnose the problem more quickly.
3. **Check for plugin updates**: Make sure you're using the latest version of UncomplicatedCustomItems. An outdated version might have bugs that have been fixed in a newer release. Use the `uciupdatecheck` command to see if an update is available.
4. **Ask for help in the Discord server**: If you're still stuck, the UncomplicatedCustomItems Discord server is the best place to get help. Be sure to provide your `.yml` file, the error message from the console, and the log code from the `ucilogs` command.
