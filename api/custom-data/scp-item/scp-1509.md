| ----------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CanResurrect`                | `bool`   | If `true`, the holder of SCP-1509 will be able to resurrect dead players. If `false`, this ability is disabled.                                    |
| `ReviveCooldown`              | `double` | The time in seconds that the user must wait before they can use the resurrection ability again.                                                    |
| `RevivedPlayerMaxahp`         | `float`  | The maximum amount of Artificial Health Points (AHP) a player receives immediately upon being revived.                                             |
| `RevivedPlayeraoeBonusahp`    | `float`  | The amount of bonus AHP granted to other living players within a certain radius of the resurrected player.                                         |
| `HumeshieldMax`               | `float`  | The maximum capacity of the Hume Shield that the holder of SCP-1509 can have.                                                                      |
| `HumeshieldRegeneration`      | `float`  | The amount of Hume Shield that regenerates per tick (or as defined by `HumeshieldRegenRate`).                                                      |
| `HumeshieldRegenRate`         | `float`  | The interval, in seconds, at which Hume Shield regeneration occurs. For example, a value of `1.0` would mean regeneration happens once per second. |
| `HumeshieldDecayRate`         | `float`  | The amount of Hume Shield that is lost per second when it is decaying (e.g., after unequipping).                                                   |
| `HumeshieldOnDamagePauseTime` | `float`  | The duration, in seconds, that Hume Shield regeneration is paused after the holder takes damage.                                                   |
| `UnequipHumeshieldDecayDelay` | `float`  | The delay, in seconds, before the Hume Shield begins to decay after the player unequips SCP-1509.                                                  |
